# macOS dotfiles

This is my starting point for a fresh install of macOS.

### Installation

run:

`chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`

### What does this do?

- Installs `brew`
- Uses `brew` to install over 50 applications (add more to `configs/Brewfile` as needed)
- Sets [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) as default shell w/ [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework and [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

### To Do

- Alias shell profiles into default locations
